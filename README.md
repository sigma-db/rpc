# sigmaDB RPC

A simple [Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API)-based RPC library for communicating via [MessagePorts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort).

Its development was motivated by the necessity to directly communicate between [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)'s main thread and UI threads.
